# ReactReduxWithApiAi
An attempt to create a chat bot using api.ai with React-Redux

Hi, I am Shraddha. This is my first Repo which I have created to add my projects what I work on when I am not working for money. :)

The coming of Artifical Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data and many such concepts, has piqued my interest in many ways. There are some individual projects I have been working on.

Now that I have started, I hope to continue moving forward.

While working on React Redux , api.ai individually and recently. I wanted to integrate them both to form a chat bot of my own. A simple chat window where we can talk to the bot configured in api.ai.

API.AI is a conversational user experience platform enabling brand-unique, natural language interactions for devices, applications and services. Developers can use API.AI services for speech recognition, natural language processing (intent recognition and context awareness), and conversation management to quickly and easily differentiate their business, increase customer satisfaction and improve business processes. They can also leverage pre-built knowledge packages across a diverse collection of popular topics built from over two and a half billion user queries processed by the system. When enabled, agents can understand thousands of diverse requests out of the box, no coding required.

To check this project out, please clone it or download it in your computer and run Once in, the client key for api.ai needs to be configured in actions/index.js. Save and then in the command line.

1. npm install & 
2. npm install --save react-modal
3. npm install --save redux-promise
4. npm install --save axios
5. npm install --save html-parse-stringify
6. npm start

The project will run on localhost:8080/chat to get the chat window.

Please leave any comments if in case you think the code needs improvement. I will be happy to learn and improve.

Thank you.
